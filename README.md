# SocGo!

A social travelling project. For the power of friendship!

## How does this whole thing work?

It's simple.
You decide to go somewhere and instead of going alone, you can pick any person/group of people that are willing to travel with other strangers. You then talk to said person for a while, figure out how the trip will go and then you just go. As stressful as it might be, in the end, it's very much worth it. You go home with a damn good trip and a new friend!

## Isn't this dangerous?

Pff, no. It's as safe as Tinder and other apps. You're gonna be fine with some common sense!
Of course, due to the nature of this app, it is only available for people aged 18 and above.

Inspiration to make this app came from [Yes Theory](https://www.youtube.com/user/PracProcrastination), I really recommend checking them out!

If you have any tips on how I could improve my code (and I'm sure there's many, I'm just a beginner after all), leave me a message at elec@franticc.co.uk.
